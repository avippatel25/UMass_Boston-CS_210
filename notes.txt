1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

[Problem 1 (Compute Edit Distance)]

Goal: Take two Strings as standard input from data\example10.txt file and to compute it's edit distance opt matrix and print is as standrad output.

Approach: After taking the two srting as standrad input from the given file, we construct the empty matrix of string length with extra row and column for gap. Now we fill the matrix by nested for loop with the needleman and wunsch concept (using min value from right, down and diagonal values) with addition of 2 for gap, 1 for mismatch and 0 for match. Finally we get the matrix with the desired value and then print it with the printf function with %3d to print values of 3 width including spaces.  

[Problem 2 (Recover Alignment)]

Goal: Take the two strings and the matrix from the program above as standard input and compute it's optimal edit distance and each elements mapping of the two string and print them with - indicating gap.

Approach: We first print all the necessary details like string x and y, there optimal alignment number. Then we get the values from opt matrix which were marked red and they are the optimal alignment. We print them as first character from x string then character from y string and their penalty. If either of the string is finished first then the other string with its elements are aligned with gap and we print them.
