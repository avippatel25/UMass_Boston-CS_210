1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

Problem 1 (Percolation Data Type): ...

Goal: We need to find if the system percolates or not.

Approach: Firstly we take a union find system of n*n and encodes its site number with 0(source),1,2,...10(sink). Secondly, we open the site if it is closed and if the site is in first row we connect to source and if it in last row we connect to sink. we then check if it connects to its neighbor sites which are open. We then return if thats a full site or not and lastly if we find that the source is connected to the sink then we say that system percolates. We make sure to throw error for percolation system whose index n is less than equal to 0 and if the interval of i and j is outside of [0,n-1]. We also use blackwash for the problem where there are sites which are not full but its reported incorrectly as full. 

Problem 2 (Estimation of Percolation Threshold): ...

Goal: We find the percolation thresold of the system.

Approach: Here we first calculate percolation thresold of a system and stores that in an array and continue this experiment 'm' times. We do that by choosing a site at random until the system percolates and find the thresold of it. Then we use mean, standard deviation and low and high values of all thresold of 'm' experiments to be 95% confident for the percolation thresold of the system. We use StdStats library for those formulas.
